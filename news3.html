    <section>
        <p><strong>BHUBANESWAR</strong> – A state of high alert has been declared along the Odisha coast as a colossal super-cluster of abandoned fishing nets, lines, and buoys—collectively known as "ghost gear"—drifts menacingly through the Bay of Bengal. The Indian Coast Guard has tracked the floating mass, estimated to be several square kilometers in size, and warns it poses a severe threat to both maritime navigation and the region's fragile marine ecosystem.</p>

        <p>The ghost net cluster was first identified 48 hours ago via satellite surveillance and has been confirmed by Coast Guard Dornier aircraft. It is currently located approximately 50 nautical miles northeast of Paradip Port, one of India's busiest shipping hubs. Currents and wind patterns indicate it is on a direct path toward the port's shipping channels and, more alarmingly, the Gahirmatha Marine Sanctuary, the world's largest nesting ground for Olive Ridley sea turtles.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "This is a silent, indiscriminate killer," said Dr. Aruna Mohanty, a senior biologist with the Odisha Wildlife Institute. "This sprawling, semi-submerged island of synthetic death will entangle and drown anything in its path—dolphins, whales, and especially the Olive Ridley turtles that are due to arrive for their annual 'arribada' or mass nesting in a few months. A disaster of this magnitude could devastate the turtle population for years to come."
        </blockquote>

        <p>Ghost gear is fishing equipment that has been lost, abandoned, or discarded at sea. It can drift for decades, continuing to trap and kill marine life in a process known as "ghost fishing." This particular super-cluster is believed to be an accumulation from years of illegal and unregulated fishing activities, consolidated by currents from recent cyclonic storms in the bay.</p>

        <h3>Emergency Response and Navigational Hazard</h3>

        <p>The Indian Coast Guard has dispatched two specialized pollution control vessels, the 'Samudra Paheredar' and 'Samudra Pavak,' to intercept the mass. The mission is fraught with challenges due to the sheer size and weight of the waterlogged nets. The primary objective is to attach trackers and attempt to tow the cluster away from the sensitive zones. If that fails, teams will undertake the perilous task of cutting it into smaller, manageable sections.</p>

        <p>A NAVAREA (Navigational Warning) has been issued for the entire region, advising all marine traffic, from large container ships to small fishing trawlers, to maintain a safe distance and report any sightings. The risk of propellers becoming entangled in the nets is extremely high and could lead to disabled vessels adrift in the open sea.</p>

        <h3>Official Maritime and Coastal Advisory</h3>
        <p>All mariners and coastal communities are advised to take the following precautions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All vessels in the northwestern Bay of Bengal must exercise extreme caution and monitor NAVAREA warnings broadcast on VHF Channel 16.</li>
            <li>Local fishermen are instructed to remain in port or stay well clear of the identified hazard zone until the all-clear is given.</li>
            <li>Coastal residents should be vigilant for smaller fragments of nets and debris washing ashore. Do not attempt to remove them yourself as they can be hazardous.</li>
            <li>Report any sightings of the main cluster or significant debris to the Indian Coast Guard at their 24/7 helpline: 1554.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <p>Environmental groups and state authorities are preparing for the worst-case scenario, which involves sections of the ghost net hitting the coastline. Teams of volunteers and wildlife officials are on standby to conduct rescue operations for any entangled animals that may wash ashore. The race is now on against time and tide to mitigate what could become one of the region's worst ecological and maritime disasters.</p>
