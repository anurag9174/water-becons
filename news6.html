        <p><strong>PANAJI</strong> – Fifteen people, including several tourists, were saved in a dramatic mid-sea rescue on Saturday afternoon after the tourist boat they were on was struck by lightning, sparking a fire and leaving them stranded in dangerously rough seas. The heroic first response by a local fishing crew has been widely praised for preventing a major tragedy.</p>

        <p>The incident occurred around 2:30 PM when the popular dolphin-watching boat, 'Goa Delight', was approximately 10 nautical miles off the coast of Panaji. A sudden and severe thunderstorm, which was not in the immediate local forecast, rapidly engulfed the area. A powerful bolt of lightning made a direct hit on the boat’s communication antenna, sending a massive electrical surge through the vessel.</p>

        <p>The surge instantly disabled the boat's engines, navigation systems, and VHF radio, leaving it dead in the water. Worse, it ignited an electrical fire in the engine compartment, which began to produce thick, black smoke. Adrift and unable to call for help, the 12 tourists and 3 crew members were in grave peril as the storm intensified.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "It was the loudest sound I've ever heard, a blinding flash, a deafening crack, and then complete darkness as all the lights went out," recounted Anjali Mehta, a tourist from Mumbai who was on board with her family. "Seconds later, someone screamed 'Fire!' The crew was amazing, they kept us calm and got us into life jackets, but looking out at the huge waves, we were terrified. We felt completely helpless."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Local Fishermen Turn Heroes</h3>

        <p>The turning point came thanks to the quick thinking of Ramesh Fernandes, the captain of the fishing trawler 'Sagar Kanya'. Spotting the plume of smoke on the horizon, Fernandes and his crew abandoned their catch and immediately headed towards the stricken vessel despite the worsening weather.</p>
        
        <p>They arrived to find the 'Goa Delight' partially ablaze and being tossed by high waves. In a difficult and dangerous operation that took nearly 30 minutes, the fishermen skillfully maneuvered their trawler alongside the burning boat, transferring all 15 stranded individuals to the safety of their vessel just as the fire began to spread to the main deck.</p>

        <p>Once the passengers were aboard, the 'Sagar Kanya' crew used their personal mobile phones to alert the Indian Coast Guard, who dispatched a fast patrol vessel and a helicopter from their base in Vasco. The Coast Guard met the fishing trawler midway, provided immediate first aid, and transferred the rescued individuals for a swift return to shore. Three people were treated for minor smoke inhalation but there were no serious injuries.</p>

        <h3>Boating Safety During Thunderstorms</h3>
        <p>This incident is a stark reminder of the dangers of rapidly changing weather at sea. Maritime authorities urge all boaters to follow these guidelines:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Always check the marine forecast from multiple sources before and during your trip.</li>
            <li>If caught in a storm, seek shelter in the cabin. Stay low and avoid contact with metal parts of the boat.</li>
            <li>Ensure your boat has multiple forms of communication, including a registered EPIRB (Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon).</li>
            <li>Regularly inspect your vessel's safety equipment, including fire extinguishers and life jackets.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <p>The Directorate General of Shipping has launched an investigation into the incident, which will review the weather reporting systems and the electrical and lightning protection systems aboard the 'Goa Delight'. Meanwhile, the captain and crew of the 'Sagar Kanya' are being hailed as heroes by a grateful community.</p>
