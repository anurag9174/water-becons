    <section>
        <p><strong>GANDHINAGAR</strong> â€“ A massive environmental crisis is unfolding in the Gulf of Kutch after two large commercial vessels collided in the pre-dawn hours of Saturday, causing a significant breach in a crude oil tanker and spilling thousands of tonnes of oil into the ecologically fragile waters off the Gujarat coast.</p>

        <p>The incident occurred approximately 15 nautical miles from Mundra Port when the Panama-flagged Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) 'MT Samudra Shakti' and the Singaporean container ship 'MV Global Trader' collided. While the container ship sustained significant bow damage, the oil tanker suffered a catastrophic gash in its port-side hull. Initial estimates from the Indian Coast Guard suggest over 20,000 metric tons of crude oil have already leaked, and the vessel continues to discharge oil.</p>

        <p>The Indian Coast Guard has launched a large-scale containment and cleanup operation, codenamed 'Operation Safai Sagar'. All 35 crew members from both vessels were rescued without major injuries. The primary focus now is on containing the sprawling oil slick, which is currently drifting south-east, directly towards the boundaries of the Marine National Park and Sanctuaryâ€”an area renowned for its coral reefs, extensive mangroves, and rare marine biodiversity.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "This is the worst-case scenario we have always feared," said Dr. Meera Joshi, a senior marine conservationist with the Gujarat Ecology Commission. "Crude oil is devastatingly toxic. It will smother the delicate coral polyps and choke the root systems of the mangroves, which are vital nurseries for countless fish species. The long-term damage to this pristine ecosystem could be irreversible if the slick reaches the shore."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Massive Cleanup and Containment Efforts</h3>

        <p>The Coast Guard has deployed its pollution control vessels equipped with floating booms to encircle the slick and skimmers to physically remove the oil from the surface. A C-130 Hercules aircraft has been tasked with dropping chemical dispersants to break down the oil into smaller droplets, a measure aimed at preventing the thickest parts of the slick from reaching the sensitive coastline.</p>

        <p>Operations at the busy ports of Mundra and Kandla have been severely disrupted, with shipping channels temporarily closed to all traffic except for emergency response vessels. The economic fallout is expected to be substantial, not just for the shipping industry but also for local fishing communities who face a long-term ban.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="safety-guidelines">
        <h3>URGENT: Public and Maritime Advisory</h3>
        <p>The Gujarat State Disaster Management Authority has issued the following directives:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> A complete ban on all fishing activities is in effect for the entire southern Gulf of Kutch region until further notice.</li>
            <li> Coastal residents are advised to stay away from beaches and shorelines due to the risk of exposure to toxic fumes and oil residue.</li>
            <li> If you find any oil-covered birds or marine animals, do not attempt to clean or rescue them yourself. Immediately report their location to the State Forest Department's wildlife rescue hotline.</li>
            <li> Untrained volunteers are urged not to participate in cleanup efforts as it can be hazardous without proper equipment and training.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <p>The Directorate General of Shipping has launched a formal investigation into the cause of the collision, which remains unknown. As the oil slick continues to expand, the coming 48 hours will be critical in the battle to protect one of India's most precious marine treasures from an unprecedented environmental catastrophe.</p>
