        <p><strong>KOCHI</strong> – A major maritime accident is unfolding in the Arabian Sea after a large container ship, the 'MV Dragon's Fortune', lost more than 100 containers overboard during a violent storm late Friday night. The Indian Coast Guard has launched a massive search and recovery operation as the containers, some containing hazardous chemicals, and their contents create a sprawling, dangerous debris field that is drifting towards the Kerala coastline.</p>

        <p>The Liberian-flagged vessel was en route from Singapore to Rotterdam when it encountered a sudden, intense squall approximately 40 nautical miles southwest of Kochi. The ship's master reported that the vessel experienced extreme rolling in the turbulent seas, causing multiple container stacks to collapse. While the ship itself remains structurally sound and is heading to Kochi port for assessment, its lost cargo now poses a significant threat.</p>

        <p>The cargo manifest indicates a mixed load, including consumer electronics, apparel, and automotive parts. However, authorities are most concerned about three containers carrying thousands of bags of vinyl chloride polymer beads—tiny plastic pellets used in manufacturing. One of these containers is confirmed to have been breached.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "We are facing a dual crisis," said Dr. Priya Nair of the Kerala Institute of Marine Sciences. "First, the floating and semi-submerged containers are like icebergs for smaller fishing boats and even larger ships. Second, the spill of these plastic 'nurdles' is an insidious ecological disaster. They will wash up on our beautiful beaches for months, if not years. Fish, turtles, and seabirds mistake them for food, leading to starvation and death. They are a poison pill for the marine food web."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Navigational Nightmare and Coastal Alert</h3>

        <p>The Indian Coast Guard has issued an urgent navigational warning to all vessels in the region. Aerial surveillance shows the debris field already stretching over 20 nautical miles. Fishermen from Kollam to Alappuzha have been ordered to suspend operations due to the high risk of collision with containers, which can be difficult to spot in the water.</p>

        <p>The Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) has put coastal villages on high alert. The first signs of debris have already started washing ashore, with reports of running shoes, sealed bags of coffee, and children's toys being found on beaches near Varkala. The concern is that the nearly invisible plastic pellets will soon follow, mixing with the sand and making cleanup incredibly difficult.</p>

    <section class="safety-guidelines">
        <h3>CRITICAL SAFETY ADVISORY</h3>
        <p>The KSDMA and the Indian Coast Guard have issued the following strict instructions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> All mariners, including fishing vessels, must avoid the designated hazard zone and report any sightings of floating containers immediately.</li>
            <li> The public is strictly forbidden from touching or collecting any items washed ashore. Some materials may be contaminated.</li>
            <li> Be extremely vigilant for small, white, or yellowish plastic pellets on the beaches. DO NOT touch them. Report their location to local authorities.</li>
            <li> A special hotline has been set up by the KSDMA for public reports: 1077.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <p>Cleanup and recovery operations are expected to be prolonged and complex. The Coast Guard is attempting to secure and tow intact containers while also tracking the spreading debris field. For the coastal communities of Kerala, the accident is a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities that come with living alongside one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.</p>
